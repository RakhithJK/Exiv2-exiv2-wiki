Welcome to the Exiv2 Wiki!

We have written articles here to provide you with explanations of the architecture of Exiv2 and the background to the project.  These articles are intended to go beyond the documentation shipped in the release bundles.  Those documents include the platform ReadMe.txt, the Exiv2 Linux Man Page, and several mark-down files such as README.md.  The Exiv2 API is thoroughly documented on https://exiv2.org which also had detailed notes about metadata standards, tag definitions, sample applications and downloads of source code and binary builds for all released versions of Exiv2.

We intend add to the Wiki articles in response to discussions with users and within Team Exiv2.
