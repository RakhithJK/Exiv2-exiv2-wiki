Welcome to the Exiv2 Wiki!

We have written articles here to provide you with explanations of the architecture of Exiv2 and the background to the project.  These articles are intended to go beyond the documentation shipped in the release bundles.  Those documents include the platform ReadMe.txt, the Exiv2 Linux Man Page, and several mark-down files such as README.md.

We intend add to those articles in response to discussions with users and within Team Exiv2.
